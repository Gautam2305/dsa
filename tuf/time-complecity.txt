Q. what is time complexity??

Ans. 
time complexity != time taken for code execution.
The rate at which the time taken increases with respect to the input size.

Big-Oh Notation - O( <time taken> )

Points to remember: 
 - Time complexity always measured in worst case scenarios.
 - Avoid constants
 - Avoid lower values

 Auxiliary space -  The space that you take to solve the problem.
 Input space - The space that you take you share the input.
